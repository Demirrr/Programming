Given a 2D matrix of n x m integers, where n represents the number of rows and m represents the number of columns.
Both n and m range from 1 to 100, inclusive.
The matrix cells may contain either a positive, a negative integer, or zero, with values ranging from -100 to 100, inclusive.
In this task, you are required to traverse the matrix diagonally from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a zigzag pattern. Start from the top-left cell, move one cell to the right (if it exists), then move one step diagonally down-left. After reaching a left (bottom) boundary, move one step down (right) and start moving diagonally up-right. Continue this pattern until you reach the last cell of the matrix. Your task is to return a list of tuples, each tuple containing the index pair (in 1-based indexing format) of cells with negative integers encountered during your traversal.
